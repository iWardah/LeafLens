# LeafLens: Enhancing Plant Disease Detection using a CNN and a Transfer Learning Approach

Crop diseases affect crop yield and quality which causes significant loss of total food production. Studies show that plant diseases cost the global economy around $220 billion each year (https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/blogs/researchers-helping-protect-crops-pests). 

This project focuses on using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to detect and diagnose plant diseases from leaf images. It implements methodologies outlined in the study "Identification of Plant-Leaf Diseases Using CNN and Transfer-Learning Approach". (https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/12/1388) aiming to enhance accuracy and efficiency in agricultural disease management.
